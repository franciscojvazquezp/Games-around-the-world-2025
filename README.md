# Games-around-the-world-2025
This repository includes a project to analyze the sales of several games in different regions of the world.
# Objective
The main purpose of this project is to understand sales performance for each game. I will carry out several steps that are going to show us the sales for region, for genre, for platform, etc.
# Methodology
**Data cleaning:** <br> 
In order to get cleaner data to be analyzed, I started to clean de column names, because they included under scores, spaces and some others characters. Also I converted the data for the columns "year_of_release" to
Int 64 and "user_score" to numeric data. Another important step was to create a new column called "total_sales" which includes the total sales for each game in all the regions. <br>
**Exploratory analysis:** <br>
As part of the analysis, I started creating a graphic that shows the total of the games released every year. Another important point to remark is the total sales for the PS2, because this game reached 1,200 millions
dollars and this information is shown by making a graphic bar. <br>
**Statistical tests:** <br>
Towards the end of the analysis I tested two hypotheses: <br>
1.- The average of the score given for the users is equal for the games of PC and Xbox One. <br>
2.- The average of the score given for the users is equal for the genre Action and Sports. <br>
